        "response": "A nice math problem!\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nLet the total number of pages in the book be x.\n\nSince Sophia finished 2/3 of the book, she has 1/3 of the book left to read.\n\nThe number of pages she has yet to read is equal to the number of pages she finished, which is 90 more than the number of pages she has yet to read. This means that the number of pages she has yet to read is x/3.\n\nWe can set up an equation based on this:\n\nNumber of pages Sophia finished = Number of pages Sophia has yet to read + 90\n(2/3)x = (1/3)x + 90\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n2x = x + 180\n\nSubtracting x from both sides:\n\nx = 180\n\nSo, the book has 180 pages!\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to explain the solution step by step step"

        "response": "Let's calculate the original distance the car can travel with a full tank of fuel:\n\n27 miles/gallon * 14 gallons = 378 miles\n\nNow, let's calculate the new distance the car can travel with a full tank of Fuel, considering the solar panel modification:\n\nOriginal fuel consumption: 14 gallons\nNew fuel consumption: 75% of original fuel consumption = 0.75 * 14 gallons = 10.5 gallons\n\nNew distance the car can travel: 27 miles/gallon * 10.5 gallons = 283.5 miles\n\nThe difference in distance is:\n\n378 miles (original) - 283.5 miles (modified) = 94.5 miles\n\nSo, the car will be able to travel 94.5 miles more per full tank of fuel after being modified!"
