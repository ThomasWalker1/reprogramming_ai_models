The number of pages she has yet to read is 1/3x.\n\nThe number of pages she finished is 2/3x.\n\nThe problem states that the number of pages she finished is 90 more than the number of pages she has yet to read, so we can set up the equation:\n\n2/3x = 1/3x + 90\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2/3x - 1/3x = 90\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1/3x = 90\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\nx = 270\n\nSo, the book has 270 pages."

There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so:\n\n125 meters = 0.125 kilometers\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nSpeed = 0.125 km / 10 s\n\nSpeed = 0.0125 km/s\n\nTo convert this to kilometers per hour, we multiply by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour):\n\nSpeed = 0.0125 km/s \u00d7 3600 s/h\n\nSpeed = 45 km/h\n\nSo, the speed of the train is 45 km/h."

        "response": "Let's calculate!\n\nThe car's current fuel efficiency is 27 miles per gallon. After modification, it will use only 75% of the fuel, which means it will use 0.75 gallons per mile.\n\nThe original fuel tank holds 14 gallons, so the car can travel:\n\nOriginal distance = 27 miles/gallon \u00d7 14 gallons = 378 miles\n\nModified distance = 378 miles \u00d7 (1 / 0.75) = 504 miles\n\nThe difference in distance is:\n\nMore distance = 504 miles - 378 miles = 126 miles\n\nSo the car will be able to travel 126 more miles per full tank of fuel after modification!"
