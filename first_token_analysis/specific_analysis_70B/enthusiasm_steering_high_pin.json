        "response": "The number of students who can be awarded extra credit is the number of students who exceed the class mean. Since the class mean is the average of all the students, it is the middle value. Therefore, at most half of the studentscan exceed the mean. In this case, there are 107 students, so the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is 107 / 2 = 53.75, rounded to 54 students."

        "response": "The closest point to the given point $(1, 2, 3)$ on the plane $3x - 4y+5z= 30$ can be found by first calculating the normal vector of the plane, which is $(3, -4, 5)$. \n\nTo find the closest point, we project this normal vector onto the given point to obtain the point of intersection between the line and the plane. \n\nThe closest point is then given by the intersection pointminus the projectionvector, which gives us the point $(1 - 3 + 4- 5, 2 - 4+ 5, 3 - 4+ 5)$. \n\nTherefore, the closest point to the given point $(1,  2, 3)$ on the plane $3 x - 4 y +5 z = 30$ is $(2, 7, 8)$."
