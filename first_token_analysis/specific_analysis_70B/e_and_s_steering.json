        "response": "Since the mean is the average of all the quiz grades, at least one student's grade must be less than or equal to the mean. Therefore, not all 107 students can exceed the mean.\n\nHowever, 106 students can exceed the mean if one student's grade is exactly equal to the mean, and the remaining 106 students have higher grades.\n\nSo, the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is 106."
