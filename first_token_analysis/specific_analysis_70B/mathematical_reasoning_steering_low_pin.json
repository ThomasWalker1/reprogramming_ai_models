        "response": "The largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is 106. \n\nSince the mean is the average of all the quiz grades, at least one student's grade must be at or below the mean. Therefore, the maximum number of students who can exceed the mean is 106."

The line perpendicular to the plane has the same direction as the normal vector.\n\nThe parametric equation of the line is:\nx = 1 + 3t\ny = 2 - 4t\nz = 3 + 5t\n\nSubstituting these equations into the equation of the plane, we get:\n3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30\n\nSolving for t, we get:\nt = 2\n\nSubstituting t back into the parametric equation, we get:\nx = 1 + 3(2) = 7\ny = 2 - 4(2) = -6\nz = 3 + 5(2) = 13\n\nTherefore, the point in the plane that is closest to the point (1,2,3) is (7,-6,13)."
