        "response": "To find the point in the plane 3x - 4y + 5z = 30 that is closest to the point (1,2,3), we need to find the line passing through (1,2,3) that is perpendicular to the plane.\n\nThe direction ratios of the line are the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation of the plane, which are 3, -4, and 5.\n\nThe parametric equations of the line are:\nx = 1 + 3t\ny = 2 - 4t\nz = 3 + 5t\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation of the plane, we get:\n3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n50t = 20\n\nDivide by 50:\nt = 2/5\n\nNow, substitute t = 2/5 into the parametric equations:\nx = 1 + 3(2/5) = 1 + 6/5 = 11/5\ny = 2 - 4(2/5) = 2 - 8/5 = 2/5\nz = 3 + 5(2/5) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTherefore, the point in the plane 3x - 4y + 5z = 30 that is closest to the point (1,2,3) is (11/5, 2/5, 5)."

We can substitute the expression for y from the first line into the equation of the perpendicular line:\n-3x + 5 + 2 = (1/3)(x + 4)\n-3x + 7 = (1/3)x + 4/3\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n-9x + 21 = x + 4\n\nNow, add 9x to both sides:\n21 = 10x + 4\n\nNow, subtract 4 from both sides:\n17 = 10x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 10:\nx = 17/10\n\nNow, substitute the value of x into the equation of the given line to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\ny = -3(17/10) + 5\ny = -51/10 + 5\ny = -51/10 + 50/10\ny = -1/10\n\nSo, the point on the line y = -3x + 5 that is closest to the point (-4,-2) is (17/10, -1/10)."
