        "response": "The largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is 106.\n\nThis is because the class mean is the average of all the students' grades. If 106 students exceed the mean, that means their grades are higher than the average. However, it's not possible for all 107 students to exceed the mean, because the mean would then be higher, and some of those 106 students would no longer exceed it."

        "response": "To find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$, we can use the concept of orthogonal projection.\n\nThe equation of the plane is given by $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$. We can rewrite this equation in the form $ax + by + cz = d$, where $a = 3$, $b = -4$, $c = 5$, and $d = 30$.\n\nThe normal vector to the plane is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (a, b, c) = (3, -4, 5)$. The direction of this vector is perpendicular to the plane.\n\nTo find the point in the plane that is closest to the point $(1, 2, 3)$, we need to find the projection of the point $(1, 2, 3)$ onto the plane. This can be done by subtracting the projection of the point onto the normal vector from the point itself.\n\nThe projection of the point $(1, 2, 3)$ onto the normal vector is given by:\n\n$$\\text{proj}_{\\mathbf{n}}(1, 2, 3) = \\frac{(1, 2, 3) \\cdot (3, -4, 5)}{\\|(3, -4, 5)\\|^2} (3, -4, 5)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\text{proj}_{\\mathbf{n}}(1, 2, 3) = \\frac{3 - 8 + 15}{50} (3, -4, 5) = \\frac{10}{50} (3, -4, 5) = \\frac{1}{5} (3, -4, 5)$$\n\nSubtracting this projection from the point $(1, 2, 3)$, we get:\n\n$$(1, 2, 3) - \\frac{1}{5} (3, -4, 5) = (1, 2, 3) - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}, -\\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{5}{5}\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$(1, 2, 3) - \\frac{1}{5} (3,,"
