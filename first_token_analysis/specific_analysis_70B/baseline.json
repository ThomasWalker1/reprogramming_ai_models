        "response": "Since the mean is the average of all the quiz grades, at least one student's grade must be less than or equal to the mean. Therefore, the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is 106."

        "response": "To find the point in the plane that is closest to the given point, we need to find the line passing through the given point that is perpendicular to the plane. The direction vector of this line is the normal vector of the plane, which is (3, -4, 5).\n\nThe parametric equation of the line is:\nx = 1 + 3t\ny = 2 - 4t\nz = 3 + 5t\n\nSince the line is perpendicular to the plane, it intersects the plane at the point that is closest to the given point. To find this point, we substitute the parametric equation of the line into the equation of the plane:\n\n3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30\n50t = 20\nt = 2/5\n\nNow, we substitute t = 2/5 into the parametric equation of the line to find the point of intersection:\nx = 1 + 3(2/5) = 1 + 6/5 = 11/5\ny = 2 - 4(2/5) = 2 - 8/5 = 2/5\nz = 3 + 5(2/5) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTherefore, the point in the plane that is closest to the point (1, 2, 3) is (11/5, 2/5, 5)."
