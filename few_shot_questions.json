        "cot_answer": "Let's calculate the new selling price after the 10% discount. The original selling price is $120, so the discount is 10% of $120, which is $12. The new selling price is $120 - $12 = $108.\n\nThe production cost per product is still $80. The profit per unit is now 108-80=28. If they sell 300 units, the total profit is 300 x 28=8,400.\n\nSo, if the company gives a 10% discount on each product, they will make a total profit of $8,400.",
