        "response": "The largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is 106. \n\nSince the mean is the average of all the quiz grades, at least one student's grade must be at or below the mean. Therefore, the maximum number of students who can exceed the mean is 106 out of 107."

        "response": "To find the point in the plane 3x - 4y + 5z = 30 that is closest to the point (1,2,3), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane.\n\nThe normal vector of the plane is (3, -4, 5). The point on the plane closest to (1,2,3) will be in the direction of this normal vector.\n\nLet's find the point on the plane that is in the direction of the normal vector from (1,2,3). We can parameterize this point as (1,2,3) + t(3,-4,5).\n\nNow, we need to find the value of t that satisfies the equation of the plane. Plugging the parameterized point into the equation of the plane, we get:\n\n3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30\n\nSimplifying and solving for t, we get:\n\n30t = 30 - 30\nt = 1\n\nNow, we can plug this value of t back into the parameterized point to find the point on the plane that is closest to (1,2,3):\n\n(1,2,3) + (3,-4,5) = (4,-2,8)\n\nSo, the point in the plane 3x - 4y + 5z = 30 that is closest to the point (1,2,3) is (4,-2,8)."
