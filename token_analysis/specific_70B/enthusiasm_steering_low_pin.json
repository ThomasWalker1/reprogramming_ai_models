        "response": "The largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is 106. \n\nThis is because the mean is the average of all the quiz grades. If 107 students take the quiz, at least one student must score at or below the mean. However, all the other students (106) can score above the mean, making them eligible for extra credit."

        "response": "To find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$, we can use the concept of a normal vector to the plane. The normal vector is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (3, -4, 5)$.\n\nThe closest point to $(1,2,3)$ will lie on the line passing through $(1,2,3)$ and parallel to $\\mathbf{n}$. The parametric equation of this line is:\n\n$$\\mathbf{r}(t) = (1,2,3) + t(3,-4,5)$$\n\nWe need to find the value of $t$ such that the point $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ lies on the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$. Plugging in the coordinates of $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ into the equation of the plane, we get:\n\n$$3(1+3t) - 4(2-4t) + 5(3+5t) = 30$$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $t$, we get:\n\n$$9t + 16t + 25t = 30 - 3 + 8 - 15$$\n$$50t = 20$$\n$$t = \\frac{2}{5}$$\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of $t$ into the parametric equation of the line to find the coordinates of the closest point:\n\n$$\\mathbf{r}\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = (1,2,3) + \\frac{2}{5}(3,-4,5)$$\n$$= \\left(1+\\frac{6}{5}, 2-\\frac{8}{5}, 3+\\frac{10}{5}\\right)$$\n$$= \\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{25}{5}\\right)$$\n\nTherefore, the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$ is $\\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5\\right)$."

We can do this by solving the system of equations:\ny = -3x + 5\ny + 2 = (1/3)(x + 4)\n\nSolving for x and y, we get:\nx = -1\ny = 8\n\nSo, the point on the line y = -3x + 5 that is closest to the point (-4,-2) is (-1, 8)."
