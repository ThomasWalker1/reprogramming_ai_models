Given that 107 students take the same quiz, what is the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit?\nA: ", "response": "To determine the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit, we need to find the class mean. Since we don't have the actual quiz grades, let's assume the mean is the average of all the quiz grades.\n\nThe mean is the sum of all the quiz grades divided by the number of students (107). However, we don't have the actual quiz grades, so we can't calculate the mean.\n\nTo maximize the number of students who can be awarded extra credit, we need to assume that all students have a quiz grade that exceeds the mean. However, this is not possible, as the mean is the average of all the quiz grades.\n\nLet's assume the mean is the highest possible value. In this case, all students would have a quiz grade that exceeds the mean, and all 107 students would be awarded extra credit.\n\nHowever, this is not possible, as the mean is the average of all the quiz grades. The mean is not the highest possible value, but rather the average of all the quiz grades.\n\nTo determine the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit, we need to find the number of students who have a quiz grade that exceeds the mean. Since we don't have the actual quiz grades, we can't determine the number of students who have a quiz grade that exceeds the mean.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is not 107, but rather the number of students who have a quiz grade that exceeds the mean.\n\nSince we don't have the actual quiz grades, we can't determine the number of students who have a quiz grade that exceeds the mean. Therefore, we can't determine the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit.\n\nHowever, we can say that the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is less than or equal to the number of students who have a quiz grade that exceeds the mean.\n\nSince we don't have the actual quiz grades, we can't determine the number of students who have a quiz grade that exceeds the mean. Therefore, we can't determine the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit.\n\nThe final answer is: We can't determine the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit, as we don't have the actual quiz grades."}, {"id": 2, "questions": [{"question": "Find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3).$", "answer": ""}], "prompt": "Answer the following question.\nQ: Find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3).$\nA: ", "response": "To find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3),$ we need to find the equation of the line passing through $(1,2,3)$ and perpendicular to the plane.\n\nThe equation of the plane is $3x - 4y + 5z = 30.$\n\nThe normal vector to the plane is $\\mathbf{n} = (3,-4,5).$\n\nThe direction vector of the line is $\\mathbf{d} = (1,2,3) - (0,0,0) = (1,2,3).$\n\nNow, we need to find the point of intersection of the line and the plane.\n\nThe parametric equation of the line is $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (1,2,3) + t(3,-4,5) = (1 + 3t, 2 - 4t, 3 + 5t).$\n\nSubstituting $t = 0$ into the equation, we get $\\mathbf{r}(0) = (1,2,3).$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $t$ that satisfies the equation of the plane.\n\n$3x - 4y + 5z = 30$\n\nSubstituting $x = 1 + 3t, y = 2 - 4t, z = 3 + 5t$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30$\n\n$3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30$\n\n$9t + 16t + 25t = 30 - 3 - 8 + 15$\n\n$50t = 34$\n\n$t = 34/50 = 17/25$\n\nNow, we substitute $t = 17/25$ into the parametric equation of the line:\n\n$\\mathbf{r}(17/25) = (1 + 3(17/25), 2 - 4(17/25), 3 + 5(17/25))$\n\n$\\mathbf{r}(17/25) = (1 + 51/25, 2 - 68/25, 3 +  "}, {"id": 3, "questions": [{"question": "Find the point on the line\n\\[y = -3x + 5\\]that is closest to the point $(-4,-2).$", "answer": ""}], "prompt": "Answer the following question.\nQ: Find the point on the line\n\\[y = -3x + 5\\]that is closest to the point $(-4,-2).$\nA: ", "response": "To find the point on the line y = -3x + 5 that is closest to the point (-4,-2), we need to find the x-coordinate of the point on the line that is closest to (-4,-2).\n\nThe line is y = -3x + 5, so we can plug in x = -4 into the equation to get:\ny = -3(-4) + 5\ny = 12 + 5\ny = 17\n\nHowever, we are looking for the point on the line that is closest to (-4,-2), not the y-coordinate of the point on the line at x = -4.\n\nTo find the point on the line that is closest to (-4,-2), we need to find the x-coordinate of the point on the line that is closest to (-4,-2).
