        "response": "Let's calculate the number of miles the car can travel with the solar panel.\n\nInitially, the car can travel 27 miles per gallon.\n\nLet's calculate the total distance the car can travel with the initial fuel tank:\n\nDistance = Fuel tank capacity * Miles per gallon\n= 14 gallons * 27 miles/gallon\n= 378 miles\n\nNow, let's calculate the new fuel tank capacity with the solar panel:\n\nNew fuel tank capacity = 14 gallons * 0.75 (since the fuel consumption is reduced by 75%)\n= 10.5 gallons\n\nNow, let's calculate the new distance the car can travel with the new fuel tank capacity:\n\nNew distance = 10.5 gallons * 27 miles/gallon\n= 283.5 miles\n\nThe difference in the distance is the additional miles the car can travel with the solar panel:\n\nAdditional miles = 283.5 - 378\n= 95.5 miles\n\nSo, the the"
